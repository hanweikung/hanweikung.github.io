I am a postdoc in the Department of Computer Science at the National University of Singapore, where I work with [Dr. Terence Sim](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/cs/people/tsim/) on AI-generated human faces and bodies. Previously I was a software engineer at [Pinscreen](https://pinscreen.com/) in Los Angeles. I received my Ph.D. in Media Arts and Technology from the University of California, Santa Barbara, advised by [Dr. Curtis Roads](https://music.ucsb.edu/people/affiliated-faculty/curtis-roads).

My CV can be found [here](./cv.pdf).
